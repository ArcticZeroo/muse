It details core components (like MemorySession, VersionManager, PromptManager, and CategoryQueryManager), outlines the MCP Tools API for querying and ingesting memory, and summarizes the overall architecture. Use this category for information about how Muse manages, organizes, and interacts with persistent memory in codebases. Not appropriate for language-specific or user-specific details.
